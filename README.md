### GeoSn0w abadoned this project, I'm going to try to finish it now. I love iDroid and thought it was super interesting!
### I'm gonna finish the guides first, then move on to file collecting and maybe update Bootlace to work with a new server.
# iDroid-Resurrected
The iDroid project was a movement started by iPhoneLinux to port the Linux kernel to the iOS Devices (and they succeeded to some extent) through OpeniBoot, an open source bootloader for iOS. The project has long been abandoned which means it will not receive any new updates from the original authors. 

Since the original website for iDroid has been down since May of 2016, the project is no longer (easily) reachable. The website did not only contain the full wiki with every tutorial for every supported device but also OpeniBoot and iDroid binaries. Can you build them yourself? Well, in theory, yes. The open source OpeniBoot is on GitHub, but requires a weird Linux setup to compile it (I did not have success following the build instructions on Linux in 2017), the toolchain needed is simply too outdated/hard to configure by today's Linux.

Considering that the project was very active back in 2010, that means a solid 7-8 years since these build tutorials were written. It is less likely you will be able to build them in 2017 without major changes, so I decided to grab my copies of OpeniBoot and iDroid binaries that I had on my previous Mac and to upload them here on GitHub alongside with some up to date tutorials on how to use them.

<b>Nota Bene!</b> I am not the original author of the iDroid, neither of OpeniBoot. I was not involved in the creation of this project at the time. The only reason I wanted to re-upload this stuff is that Android on iPhone has never been done since iDroid, or ever since, and with all websites down and virtually no mirror (or trustworthy mirror) to the original files, this project would be forgotten which should never happen. This is a piece of history that should live forever in a form or another. It was the first, and I am pretty sure the last time when someone got full Android working on an iPhone / iPod.

<p><b>Limitations of iDroid/OpeniBoot</b><p>
<ul>
  <li>This will only work on <b>iPhone 2G, iPhone 3G or iPod Touch 1st Generation</b></li>
  <li>This will only work on the aforementioned devices running on iOS up to 4.1, iOS 4.2.1 and newer versions are incompatible. Downgrades can be made, please refer to the downgrade tutorial on this Git.</li>
  <li>Paraphrasing the original iDroid project, this is an alpha build which means it is not 100% compatible. Prior iOS / Linux knowledge may prove useful. Also, if you're afraid of messing up your device (can be restored and fixed), avoid this project.</li>
</ul>
